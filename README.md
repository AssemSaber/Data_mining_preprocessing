<h1>Health Care Preprocessing</h1>

<h2>Handling Missing Values</h2>
<p>Observation: Approximately 20% of the dataset, especially in the age column, contained missing values.</p>
<p>Solution: The mean was calculated for each medication, excluding outliers.</p>

<h2>Exploration Findings</h2>
<p>After exploration, I found that cross-field checks, such as date , were fine. Additionally, each column containing string values was consistent.</p>
